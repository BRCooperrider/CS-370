## Briefly expalin the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

### The work I did on this project was creating the Q-Training Algorithm code block. It involves adding logic to move the pirate to the treasure at the end of the maze in the fewest moves as possible. All of the other code and files were given.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

### Computer scientists are scientists that use computers to conduct research, among many other things. It matters because computers are an incredibly useful tool for conducting research and studying how the world works around us. I approach a problem as a computer scientist by breaking it down into many smaller pieces, and work my way up. Understanding the foundation of a problem leads to better understanding of the problem I'm trying to solve in the first place. My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization is to make sure there is no hidden information that can harm someone. Complacency is key when building up reputation among users and the organization, so being transparent about what is being worked on is vital.
